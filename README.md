# Python-Costco-Sales-Analysis

Good evening to to all! I figured why not create a project based on the very one company I work for, Costco! (Sign up now for an executive membership for $120 annually and get back 2% on your purchases.) 

Lets get back to it. In the following project, I answered these questions: 

## 1. What is the overall sales trend?
## 2. What are the top 10 products by sale?
## 3. Which are the most selling products?
## 4. Which is the most preferred ship mode?
## 5. Which are the most profitable category and sub-category?

The results are surprising as they do not align with the sales made at my warehouse #1124.
